# Data-Manipulation-and-reporting-with-Power-BI
Project Overview

This project is a Business Analytics dashboard built in Power BI to analyze restaurant performance, customer ratings, and cuisine trends using Zomato data. The dashboard helps identify patterns in pricing, ratings, and location-based performance to support better business decisions.

Problem Statement
